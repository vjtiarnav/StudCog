# StudCog
An app maintaining a student cognizance system to address the complaints of all students in university/college/school.
In the app there are two logins, one for the student and the other for the college admin. 
Once the student logs in with username and password, they have to fill the form where their details such as college name, 
registration number, area of complaint, detailed description of the complaint and a photo of the complaint need to be filled. 
Once this form is submitted, it becomes visible to the admin and so they can provide a solution to the issue. Once they provide a solution, 
it is visible to the respective student. (also can be extended to office campuses)
