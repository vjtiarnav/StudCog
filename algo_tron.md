## 💸Applications

Students studying in colleges face many challenges regarding resources. Sometimes there is no proper seating arrangement, no proper internet connectivty or a major issue of lost and found items. In order to reduce this hassle and make learning a smooth experience for the students, we have created the "STUDCOG" App wherein the students can easily post their complaints/issues and get the solutions as quickly as possible.

In the app there are two logins, one for the student and the other for the college admin. Once the student logs in with his/her username and password, he has to fill the form where his/her details such as college name, registration number, area of complaint, detailed description of the complaint and a photo of the complaint need to be filled. Once this form is submitted, it becomes visible to the admin and so he can provide a solution to the issue. The solution wil be provided to the student via registered college email id within a given period of time (5 days), if not student can re-register the same complaint as explained in the comments box pop-up.
